		<p>Why Sawdust in the Soup?</p>
		<p>		We built our own house with a lot of help from friends and especially my dad. We always made sure to have a good meal for the crew which usually meant cooking on the job site. I was once cooking sausage soup on the portable stove built by my grandad while the windows were being framed and the air was full of sawdust . And the idea of Sawdust in the Soup was born.</p>
